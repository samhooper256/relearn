relearn is a math trainer designed to help students in roughly grades 3 to 8 practice math concepts such as the basic four operations, exponentiation, roots, unit conversions, fractions, mixed numbers, and more. Below is a demonstration video that goes into more depth about why we created the app and how it works.
